# 🌱 Sustainable Hub

An AI-powered web application to promote sustainable living, developed as part of my internship at Haegl Technologies.

## 🚀 Overview

**SustainableHub** is a Django-based platform that integrates machine learning models to help users:
- 📸 Classify waste using image inputs.
- 🌾 Recommend suitable crops based on soil and weather data.
- 🌍 Track and reduce carbon footprint based on daily lifestyle activities.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python, Django, MySQL
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **AI/ML**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Pretrained `.sav` models
- **Other**: LaTeX (project documentation), Power BI (data visualization)

## 🧩 Modules

### 1. Waste Classification
- Upload an image of waste
- AI model classifies it (e.g., biodegradable, plastic)
- Suggests eco-friendly disposal methods
- Rewards users for correct disposal

### 2. Crop Recommendation
- Model predicts soil type and predicts the best suitable crop to be grown
- Recommends crops with info like:
  - Soil PH levels
  - N- Nitrogen
  - K- Potassium
  - P- Phosphorous
  - Temperature

### 3. Carbon Footprint Tracker
- User inputs daily habits (e.g., transport, groceries, electricity)
- Calculates estimated emissions
- Suggests ways to reduce carbon impact
- Points awarded for sustainable choices


## 🛡️ Features

- Role-based login (Admin/User)
